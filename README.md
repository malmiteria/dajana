a programming language with good UX


## My Goal
I wanna design a programming language with good UX. This means a few things :
 - listing a few important use cases
 - reading over pros and cons of multiple langages solution (if any) to those use cases
 - evaluating the UX of those solutions
 - designing my own solution, based on what i learnt (and evaluating it too).
 
I will mostly back my UX evaluation based on this [french resource](https://www.usabilis.com/le-guidage-criteres-ergonomiques-de-bastien-et-scapin/#:~:text=Quatre%20sous%2Dcrit%C3%A8res%20participent%20au,d%C3%A9finition%20de%20l'ergonomie).
which in english translates to this list or criteria (translated on reverso):
1. Guidance
   1. Inducement
   2. Grouping / Distinction between Items
      1. Grouping / Distinction by location
      2. Grouping / Distinction by format
   3. Immediate Feedback
   4. Readability

2. Workload
   1. Brevity
      1. Conciseness
      2. Minimum Actions
   2. Information Density

3. Explicit Control
   1. Explicit Actions
   2. User control

4. Adaptability
   1. Flexibility
   2. Consideration of User Experience

5. Error Management
   1. Protection against Errors
   2. Quality of Error Messages
   3. Correction of Errors

6. Homogeneity / Coherence

7. Meaning of Codes and Denominations

8. Compatibility


I will also mostly back my listing of use cases on my real life experience as a developper, using knowledge managment interview techniques.
